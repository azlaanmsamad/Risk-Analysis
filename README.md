# Risk-Analysis
This repo contains two hobby project: Monte Carlo simulations for sales commission budget and Random Walk for Apple Stock Prediction (Risk Analysis)

*Monte Carlo Simulation for Sales Commision Distribution*
The Problem is as follows:

- There are a given number of sales representative who have to meet the Target sales, and based on the percentage of the target reached they are alloted a commision rate.
- We have already known two types of ditributions from the historical data namely: 
  - Percent to target: Follows a normal distribution. 
  - Target Sales frequency distribution: This represents the target sale value with its probability
- We use this data to perform Monte Carlo Simulations.

- What is the problem statement? 
The company sales manager is asked to allocate a certain amount of budget for the sales department. He has to make a decision taking into the consideration, the total sales target, total actual sales achieved and the commision based on precent of the target achieved.
